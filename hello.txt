Beneath the sky, where stars are born,
A gentle breeze, a sweet reborn,
The moonlight paints the earth below,
A canvas vast, where dreams may grow.

In fields of green, the flowers dance,
They twirl and spin in pure romance,
The rivers hum a soft refrain,
Of timeless love, of joy, of pain.

The mountains rise, so bold, so wise,
With secrets kept beneath their skies,
And oceans sing with endless grace,
A lullaby, the heart’s embrace.

Through quiet nights and golden dawns,
The soul finds peace where silence dawns,
A melody that calls us near,
In every whisper, love is clear.

So let your heart be free, and fly,
Like birds that soar in endless sky,
For in this world of light and shade,
The beauty lies in love we’ve made.
